      I'm sure you're familiar with email spam. Sometimes this is genuine spam
      that you never want to see. But sometimes it's a mail from another
      business you're working with, but on a topic totally unrelated to your
      relationship with them.


      Those mails are annoying, aren't they?


      So with Notifium, you can sign your customers up to different groups. And
      then when you send an update, you can select which groups you want to send
      it to.


      And it's up to you how you set those groups up. You can just have one big
      group if you want to, or you can create as many groups as you need to run
      your business.


      By doing this, no-one receives messages that aren't relevant to them.
