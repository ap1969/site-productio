      Once you have written your notification, and decided which group of
      customers to send it to (or all of them), you simply press "send".


      Within seconds, that notification is sent to all those customers and
      alerts them on their mobile phone. 


      No matter where they are in the world.


      And unlike posting to social media, there's no competition for that
      notification. It doesn't get buried in other updates about their work
      colleague's night out, or a video of a dog on a surfboard, or a funny
      joke, or all the other things that people share on social media.


      It's quick. It's unmissable. It's effective.
