          One of the best marketing tools for any business is to use instant
          notifications to grab your customer's attention. Notifium gives you
          this without needing your own mobile app.

          The service is easy for you to use, and easy for your customers to
          use. That means you won't get them asking you for support on our app,
          leaving you free to work on your actual business. Or just to take a
          break.

          When you tell customers about the notification service, you can split
          them into different groups: young vs old, male vs female, by the area
          they live, the type of work they do, or any other way you need to.


          You can then target specific notifications to certain groups of
          customers, allowing you to tailor your marketing messages to suit
          their wants and needs.


          It also means you won't annoy other customers by sending them
          irrelevant updates.

          Although the effectiveness of social media updates are perhaps
          decreasing, it's still useful for your existing customers to be able
          to share your notifications.


          And they can do that via the mobile app, sharing through Facebook,
          Twitter, or anywhere else they are socially active.


          Which means that as those sites and apps come and go, you let **them**
          switch between sites, so you don't need to keep on top of which apps
          are hot right now.

          Email marketing is one of the easiest methods to keep in contact,
          which is why so many larger businesses do it. But it's not always easy
          - how much time do you want to spend on a marketing campaign, only for
          it to end up in your customers' spam folders?

          Facebook, Twitter, Instagram all sound great. But you're fighting
          against friends, relatives, work colleagues, and viral videos of dogs
          on surfboards.
