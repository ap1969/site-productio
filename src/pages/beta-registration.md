          "Beta" is a term used in the software industry, normally meaning it's
          a small-scale launch when the software is deemed to be ready for
          launch, but add an extra piece of validation.


          Invariably, no matter how well tested the software is, when actual
          customers start using it, they discover things. Maybe they find a bug
          that the testing didn't resolve. Maybe the tutorials aren't very good
          at explaining things. Maybe the flow of the software isn't the best
          for new users.


          All these things are great for the software creators to find out
          before they go for a big public launch. Hence the smaller-scale beta
          launch.


          Also, the creators would normally hope to get a few testimonials from
          the beta customers, that they can use in their marketing materials in
          the public launch.
        question: What is a "beta" launch?
      - answer: >-
          Probably about 2 months at most. It depends on what feedback we get,
          and how intensely the beta customers use the software, but 2 months is
          a good estimate.
        question: How long will the beta last?
      - answer: >-
          We're only looking for a small number of beta customers, up to 100.
          This is because it's better to have a small number of active users,
          than a large number of customers who register but never really use the
          service.


          As such, we're requesting a little information first - as well as your
          name and email address, we'll also ask a little about your business,
          so we can confirm what types of businesses are interested. We'll also
          ask what you do in terms of marketing already, so we can look at the
          fit between Notifium.com and your existing marketing.


          Finally, we are asking a small fee, but it's an 80% discount on the
          standard monthly fee when we go live (which will be $50 per month). So
          only $10 a month for the beta customers. And once we go live, that $10
          a month will remain their price. And there's no setup fee, and no
          long-term contract - just a month-by-month subscription that our
          customers can cancel at any point.
        question: What are the requirements for beta access?
      - answer: >-
          The **normal** monthly price will be $50 per month, with no set-up fee
          and no contract. Customers can cancel at any point and their
          subscription will last till their next payment due date, then get
          cancelled.


          For the **beta customers**, the price for their entire subscription
          will be $10 per month, and their subscription will **remain** after
          the beta period - there will be **no** increase up to the standard
          $50.
        question: >-
          What does the beta cost, and how does that compare to the normal
          price?
