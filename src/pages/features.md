      The business benefits of posting updates to social media sites are
      reducing as those sites scramble to make a profit.


      They make a profit through ads, which they want to show to thousands, or
      millions, of users.


      Which means they prioritise that viral video of a dog on a surfboard
      rather than your smaller business which probably has a smaller target
      audience.


      It's also difficult to share your content to Facebook, and Twitter, and
      Instagram, and Pinterest, and ... and ... and.


      But - it's still useful if people can share your business to their own
      contacts.


      So Notifium offers two ways to do that:


      First, your customers can share via their app, to whichever social
      networks they are active on.


      Second, your notification will also be available online (if you choose)
      and people that find it via the search engines can also socially share it
      from there.
